# Quick Answer: Why Only 7 Widgets?

## TL;DR

**This is working correctly!** 

You're only seeing 7 widgets in the customizer because only 7 modules are enabled in your family's settings.

---

## What You're Seeing

✅ **Enabled Modules** (7 widgets available):
- Chores
- Screen Time  
- Credits
- Shopping
- To-Dos
- Calendar
- Weather (always available)

❌ **Disabled Modules** (7 widgets not showing):
- Projects → Would add "My Project Tasks" widget
- Transport → Would add "Transport" widget
- Communication → Would add "Recent Messages" widget
- Health → Would add "Medications" widget
- Maintenance → Would add "Maintenance" widget
- Inventory → Would add "Inventory" widget
- Meal Planning → Would add "Today's Meals" widget

## How to Get All Widgets

### Option 1: Enable Modules (Recommended)

1. Go to **Settings** → **Modules**
2. Enable the modules you want to use
3. Refresh your dashboard
4. Open customizer again
5. New widgets will appear automatically!

### Option 2: Use Module Features First

The widgets appear on your dashboard because the modules are enabled at the family level, but you might not have access to customize them based on your permissions.

## What I Added

I've added a helpful **blue tip box** in the customizer that will show when you have fewer than 14 widgets:

```
ℹ️ Tip: More widgets will appear here when you enable 
additional modules in Settings.
```

This message includes a link to the module settings page.

## Why This Design?

**Security & UX**: 
- Only shows widgets you can actually use
- Prevents confusion about missing features
- Cleaner, more focused customization experience
- Widgets automatically appear when you enable their modules

---

## Next Steps

1. **Hard refresh** your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Open the customizer** - you'll see the new tip message
3. **Click the Settings link** in the tip
4. **Enable the modules** you want
5. **Come back to customizer** - new widgets will be there!
