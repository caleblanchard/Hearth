## Tips & Tricks

### Best Practices

1. **Put Important Items First**: Place widgets you check most often at the top
2. **Hide Unused Widgets**: Declutter by hiding widgets you rarely use
3. **Group Related Items**: Keep similar widgets together (e.g., all personal tasks)
4. **Experiment**: Try different layouts to find what works best for you

### Role-Based Views

Different family members may find different layouts useful:

**Parents:**
- Family overview widgets at top (Calendar, Communication, Shopping)
- Administrative widgets visible (Approvals, Maintenance)

**Children:**
- Gamification widgets prominent (Chores, Credits, Screen Time)
- Personal task widgets (To-Dos, Projects)

### Module Awareness

Widgets are automatically filtered based on your family's enabled modules:
- If a module is disabled, its widget won't appear in the customizer
- When a new module is enabled, its widget appears automatically (hidden by default)
- This keeps your customization panel clean and relevant

## Keyboard Shortcuts

When the customizer is open:
- **Tab** - Navigate between widgets
- **Space** - Toggle widget visibility
- **Enter** - Save changes
- **Esc** - Cancel and close

## Troubleshooting

### Changes Not Saving

- Check your internet connection
- Ensure you clicked "Save Changes" before closing
- Try refreshing the page and customizing again

### Widget Not Appearing

- Check if the corresponding module is enabled in Settings
- Verify you have permission to access that module
- Try resetting to default layout

### Customize Button Missing

- Ensure you're logged in (not browsing as a guest)
- Refresh the page
- Clear your browser cache

## FAQ

**Q: Will my customization affect other family members?**  
A: No, each family member has their own personal layout. Your changes only affect your view.

**Q: What happens if a module is disabled after I customize?**  
A: The widget will be automatically hidden and removed from your layout until the module is re-enabled.

**Q: Can I customize the mobile view differently?**  
A: Currently, the same layout applies to all devices. Mobile devices show widgets in a single column.

**Q: Can I create multiple layout presets?**  
A: This feature is planned for a future update. Currently, you have one saved layout.

**Q: What's the default layout?**  
A: The default layout shows all available widgets in a priority order: frequently used items first (Chores, Screen Time, Calendar, etc.), followed by less-frequently accessed items.

## Privacy & Data
